# stretchRes

Simple Tool to set your strech res via command prompt! It's oddly easy to make, so I thought I would open source it.

NOTE: This only works off of current resoultions you have, e.g if you have 1440 x 1080 it will work, but if you do not have it as a custom resolution/resolution, it will just leave your monitor blank (the program will reset it).

Setup & Usage

Download the github repository
Open the StrechRes.sln (yes i know i spelt stretch wrong I was in a rush and I am too lazy to rename it)
once opened, do the following keyboard combination:
```
CTRL + SHIFT + B
```

After, wait around 5 seconds and go back to file explorer. Open the StrechRes folder, then open Bin\Debug (or release)\ and then open the StrechRes.exe file.

This is totally open sourced, meaning you can change this to how you prefer. I plan on making it better and adding more features, this is what I have for now.
